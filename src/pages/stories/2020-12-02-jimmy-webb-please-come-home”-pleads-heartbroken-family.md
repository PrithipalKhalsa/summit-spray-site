On Saturday a van pulled up to our office wanting to post a missing persons bulletin. The smell of three people and a dog living in a van ended the life of any small animal in a five mile radius.



“Jimmy please come home! We ran out of opium treats for your drug addicted dog, he is starting to scare us and we need you home. Did you run away because we called you Shaggy for years because of your lame ass hair? We promise, if you get a haircut, we will stop calling you that.”



It seems that Webb’s dark past of gang activities and life of crime (solving) was catching up to him. If you want our advice, Jimmy, probably stay far away from this ‘gang’ you’ll be safer sticking to highballs. You’ll definitely smell better as well.



“But seriously where do you keep those treats, we are keeping him in a cage but he’s gnawing through the metal. Wait, oh no, he’s escaped, please shagg- I mean Jimmy, please come home he’s loose!”
