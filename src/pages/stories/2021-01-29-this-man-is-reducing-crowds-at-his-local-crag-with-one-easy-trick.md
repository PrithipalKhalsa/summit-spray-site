“I just miss the days when this was a community that cared about each other and about climbing. Now everyone and their mom wants to be a part of it. The climbing community has tripled in the last year. I can’t remember that many names!” Reno Local Brad Needle moved to Nevada ‘pre-Tesla’ and has since watched his beloved crags become overrun with climbers.



“So I got the bright idea to start slashing tires. It’s really quite effective. It not only keeps them away but it also gives me a rush, I honestly can’t stop, it’s a power complex or something.” Brad explained to us as we kept a close eye on our new snow tires. “I specifically target climbers who hurt my feelings by climbing higher grades than me. How dare they?! Don’t they know that I have been here longer than them!”

“This is just a gentle deterrent, paired with the notes I leave on their car, it usually keeps them away from Donner Summit.” We took a look at one of these notes. There were no words written. It was just a piece of paper with blood and glitter on it. Chilling stuff.
