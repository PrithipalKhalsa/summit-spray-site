Access Fund is set to launch their brand new access initiative come January 20th. The initiative is slated to fund the installation of auto belays in the capitol, primarily on the walls outside of the Capitol building, inside the Oval Office, and on the Supreme Court Building to help prevent the fall of American democracy.



We spoke with an Access Fund representative to get a deeper understanding of their 2021 master plan. "We are aiming to provide support to newly developing crags in locations easy to access from major metropolitan areas. We have seen a huge uptick in climbers flocking to these historically overlooked climbing areas, putting up first ascents while also trampling on the constitution."



These inner city crags have often been seen as climbing gyms and not as real outdoor climbing areas. Access Fund went on to give us a sneak peek at their plans to launch a new 'Gym-to-Crag' program centered on the Washington D.C. climbers. "We want to usher in a new era of cooperation and diplomacy between climbers and land managers. There is a lot of work to be done to bring everyone to the table and build a strong relationship moving forward."



To help fundraise for the 2021 initiatives, Access Fund is now partnering with The North Face to bring members exclusive t-shirts branded with the new slogan: "most walls are meant for climbing."
