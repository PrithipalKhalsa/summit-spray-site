Climber and shameless man Erik Sanderson has recently proven that he really does have the audacity to ask you to wake up at ungodly hours of the morning again just to catch him whipping on the same piece of gear that he’s been whipping on for months now. Last week he said that the extra squats he’d been doing would surely give him that tiny extra oomph he needed to tip the scale for the send, but it seems that he squatted for nothing, because he still fell at the spock hold.



After 3 unsuccessful burns on the route, he decided that was enough for this week and that it was too hot to keep trying at this point in the day. “I just can’t use the finger locks if it’s above 55 degrees out.” he informed us. When it was brought to his attention that it was actually only 53 out, he paused and scratched his head for a moment before asking, “Well, did you read that on Climbing Weather or somewhere else? It’s not very accurate if you just check the nearest town instead of the actual crag.”



We asked his belayer to comment, and all they had to say was “If it wasn’t for the lunch he usually buys me on the way home, I’d have strangled him by now.” We will check back in with Sanderson next week to see if he’s made any progress, assuming the weather is good.
