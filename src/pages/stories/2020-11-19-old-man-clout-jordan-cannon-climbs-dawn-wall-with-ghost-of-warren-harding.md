“It was a close call there, I almost had to climb with someone my own age!” Jordan told us when we interviewed him in the comment section of his instagram post. “Mark Hudon, didn’t want to climb with me, he said something about how I was ‘driving his old man bod into the ground’, but I think he’s got a few more walls left in him.” “I mean like what else is he going to do with those muscular forearms? Hug his friends and family? Lame.”

“I just don’t relate to kids my age” Cannon said when asked about his age preference “I have no idea what a ‘yeet’ is and I don’t want to learn.”

We tried to reach out to Hudon for comment, but we only use instagram so we aren’t sure he ever existed anyway. We also tried to interview Warren, but his banshee scream left us deaf and our souls hollow.
