“Watch me!” 29 year old Emily Coffman squealed as she shakily placed her second piece of protection 8 feet from the anchor. The aging dirtbag is entering her third year of ‘totally getting health insurance next week’. As Coffman lowered off the chains, we breathed a sigh of relief while the thought of holding her head together in the back of an uber subsided.



“I felt in total control the whole time.” Coffman lied when asked about the physical and financial risk she had just undergone. “Honestly, I was kinda banking on grand daddy Bernie getting elected so he can dish out some much needed universal health care. Now that he is definitely not getting elected I’ll totally get insurance now, probably.”



“My close friend Jen tried med school for a few semesters and she has been doing my checkups for the last few years. I’m not too worried about getting sick, I’ve been drinking a nutrition smoothie every morning to keep me healthy. It consists of vitamin C, coconut, orange peels, mangos, beans and gravel. Plus if I ever get injured I have like 5 rolls of climbing tape.”
