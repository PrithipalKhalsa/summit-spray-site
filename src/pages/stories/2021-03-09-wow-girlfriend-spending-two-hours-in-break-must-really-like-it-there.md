After two full hours of being absolutely pummeled by the short period break at low tide, Area boyfriend, Toby, reports that his girlfriend is “probably having a good time”, and that he will not be paddling in anytime in the near future.



He also wanted to note that he lent her a wetsuit that, although a few sizes too big, was likely keeping her “warm enough” in the winter swell.



“You know, Nadine never really seemed too stoked on surfing until recently and it really shows how much she enjoys it by how fucked up she’s getting out there”.



Unfortunately Nadine was not available for comment as she was still getting totally slammed by the break, but we can safely assume she is very much in control and is definitely enjoying every second of it.
