We caught up with Christina, after van dwelling for the past 7 months. They insisted that the thrill comes from “an independent lifestyle” and the ability to “travel to any city where my friends have a house I can cook in.” While Christina insists that the lifestyle has helped build autonomy, we also noticed they were shoving their bag full of donuts during the interview.



“I’ve been able to go from city to city and I just shoot my friends a message so I can sleep in their driveway,” Christina muses, “I’m usually out of way around 11am after a shower, coffee, and frying a couple of vegan eggs.” Christina commented that it’s been incredibly nice that the pandemic has all of their friends working from home, “I know they’ll always be around to let me in for a quick fill up on my water jugs, and to empty my pee bottle in their toilets.”



Christina expressed a deep longing to travel to the pacific northwest after a quick month-and-a-half stop at their parent’s place in LA to recharge. With opportunities to work on a farm and live in a co-operative fashion, not unlike the lifestyle Christina has already adopted.
