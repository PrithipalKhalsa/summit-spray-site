Most production of holds is done outside of the US already, but it’s still a sad day when American manufacturing, and its jobs, leave for another country. Following the recent USDA Forest Service ban on manufacturing new routes in Ten Sleep Canyon, developer Aurie Donelson is looking to begin chipping, drilling, and glueing Ten Sleep routes overseas.



“This decision was not a reflection of the capabilities, the performance, or even the progress of our manufacturing in Ten Sleep”, comments Aurie Donelson from his climbing ranch in Ten Sleep Wyoming. “It was driven by the ideology of being the most innovative, design-focused crag in this space and ensuring that our designs and our innovations can be manufactured in the absolute best places in the world. We’re looking at facilities in Taiwan, but it’s still undecided”



When asked if his choice to move manufacturing overseas was a strategy to increase tourism and thus profits for his climbing ranch. He avoided the question stating “I understand there is a concern of quality with this transition. My new guide book will state if the route was ‘Made In USA’ or ‘Made In Taiwan’. So you can see there is no drop in quality between the different manufacturing centers”.
