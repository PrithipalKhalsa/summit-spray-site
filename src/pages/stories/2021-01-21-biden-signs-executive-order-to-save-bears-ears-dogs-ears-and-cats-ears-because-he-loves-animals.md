Earlier this month, Joe Biden established a literal ground breaking accent when he climbed out of the grave into the oval office. During his first day in office he unleashed a slew of executive orders in an effort to jumpstart the administration's agenda. Due to his rare disease of probably a lot of different stuff, he misunderstood what Bears Ears was. Along with saving various ears, he also made executive orders to bring rotary phones back, a ban on outdoor ‘fashion’, and to ‘get off his damn lawn’.



“Due to the previous administrations incompetence, they let unregulated outdoor fashion go too far.” Joe Biden was horrified when his aides showed him photos of the new Eddie Bauer line. “I got a jacket like that in 1981 for my 120th birthday and I still haven’t taken the tags off. I even saved the receipt.”

After a conversation at the inauguration with Amanda Gorman (who was wearing Prada), Biden included in his Outdoor Fashion bar a clause specifically calling for the halt of the North Face + Gucci collab. Biden referred to the collaboration as, “kinda sick, but also super wack that an outdoor brand is leaning more toward fashion than function.” Biden is also rumored to be talking to Ashima Shirashi about coming back to climbing from her career as a fashion icon.
