We approached ten-thousand year old climber Chris Kalous as he struggled to locate the downclimb of a high as hell, ketamine saturated stallion. He had established a groundbreaking boltless accent that he will totally never shut up about for all time.



“I don’t even remember how long I’ve been up here, long enough to be a local at least!” Kalous started to lecture when we offered our help. “As a local, it’s my responsibility to set the standard for how things are done. I’m definitely not stuck up here. Just like this horse, I can stop and come down anytime I want to.”



“Well, I don’t want to place any bolts, that’s super unethical,” Kalous said when we asked him how he planned to make his descent.“I made this ascent using only natural protection, I made an A6 anchor off of this beast’s colossal shlong for Christ’s sake. I’m not about to jeopardize this route with a rap station!” “The most et hical thing to do at this point is to use the natural protection provided and rappel off of it’s neck.”
