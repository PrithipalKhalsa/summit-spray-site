This holiday season we spoke with the REI employee who was lurking in our bushes about how he is #optingoutside. As we sat inside opening presents we noticed a try-hard outdoor enthusiast covered head to toe in gear that did not reflect his paycheck.



“I just wanted to make sure you guys were members.” He said defensively when we asked him why he was peeping.”You get all sorts of benefits as members, including: 10% of your time back from this conversation, discounts on telling me to fuck off, a Fleet Foxes album, and a copy of Wild by Cheryl Strayed”. “We have a special deal currently that if you become a member today, I’ll stop asking you to become a member and leave you alone.”



It was clear from the extravagant camping gear and smell that he had been camped out behind our bushes for quite some time. “Well… last time you were at our store, you said you would think about becoming a member of the co-op.” He said, when we mentioned our last REI store visit was in 2018. “So I followed you home to make sure you were going to think about it.”
