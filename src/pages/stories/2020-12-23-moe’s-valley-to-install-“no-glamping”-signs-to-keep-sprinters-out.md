Clearly Sprinter Vans can’t take a hint with the “No Camping in Moe’s Valley” push. St. George has taken measures to end Glamping as well, hoping this will get the message across.\

Despite Sprinters being even more destructive on the land than several stray dirtbags, Sprinters are not technically camping. “They are more like a mobile apartment,” BLM official’s stated. They also noted that several bay area tech guys are planning to sue, saying ‘You can’t evict me, my dad’s a lawyer.’

Many dirtbags are upset by this classification and say there is foul play involved. Witnesses say that Glampers are bribing park officials with perks like:



* A really nice cup of coffee from that sweet pourover set up
* Great portraits with a photo ready golden retriever (an optional add on for new sprinter vans)
* Free shoutout and promo on Glamper’s instagram page, yeah of course they’re an influencer



These have all helped grease the bureaucratic wheels of parks officials and kept the dream alive for so many upper middle class people who are “just trying it out.”
