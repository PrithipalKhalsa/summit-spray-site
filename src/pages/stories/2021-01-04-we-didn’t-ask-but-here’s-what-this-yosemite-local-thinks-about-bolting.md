“I just think if you absolutely have to put bolts in, you should at least do it on the first ascent, on lead, on a nice fall day, under a rising moon, wearing teal lycra, just after a shower.” Local climbing dinosaur, Chongo Chuck, interjected, while we were interviewing a park ranger. We had gone to Yosemite with the intention of interviewing residents about the dangers of traveling during a pandemic. In the end Chongo was louder, so we ended up interviewing him instead.

“That’s how we all did it back in the day. Rap-bolting is just disrespectful to the hours of chipping and pinning it took to make the climb doable at the cutting edge grade of 5.11. If we can’t follow the mental gymnastic dogma of the old days how are we expected to gain the respect of my dad. Plus it’s like royal robbins always said: ‘if you don’t follow the rules, then you can’t be in our club.’”

“If you don’t have the balls to lead the climb ground up, simply peer pressure the next generation to do it. Let them climb in a contrived, dangerous, outdated style instead of bolting it now. Let them risk their own young lives to make old men happy."
