“It’s incredible really, when you look into their eyes, it feels almost like looking in a mirror, a species that is almost human.” We spoke to near ghostly David Attenborough on his study of a dwindling primate species: the stone monkey.



“Their habitat is shrinking everyday, as more humans move into Yosemite Valley these granite primates are running out of space to dwell. As the wall clog up with weeked ‘go-getters’ and the grazing plains of Camp 4 are taken up by tourists, there is almost nowhere else they can roam free.”



“The real trouble is the intentional eviction of their habitat by rangers. These poachers chase them into boulder dens, thus, removing them from their home permanently.”



Attenborough is currently gathering donations in an effort to save the last remaining stone monkeys. His project is simple: he picks them up in Yosemite Valley and drops them off in the Utah desert with a gallon of water and an instagram account for communication.



“For many years it was believed that Yosemite was the only place they could live, but we are finding that is not the case. They have adapted to becoming a more nomadic species. Traveling with the seasons and maybe leaving a ‘thing or two’ at their parents house.”
