Last weekend, in Indian Creek, UT, environmental demonstrators with the best intention destroyed acres of fragile, ancient cryptobiotic Soil. The march lasted 2 hours and consisted of rhyming chants and exchanges of absurd incorrect facts learned from TikTok. 



“Some crypto can be 10,000 years old, it’s frail and we wanted people to be informed. We were blind-sided by this display of humanity’s cruelty.” LNT spokesperson announced in regards to the mishap. “This is no ordinary whoopsie-daisy. We may never see crypto here again. It’s irreversible.”



Demonstrators removed the “Please Use Established Trails” signs citing that these interfere with the area’s natural beauty and they felt limited by it. The demonstrators achieved their goal of 2,500 e-signatures and some activist clout. 



Unsure of what Cryptobiotic Soil actually looked like, they wandered for hours trying to save it. All the while busting the crust. Many ‘outdoor stewards’ came armed with a savior complex and a pot. Their mission was to save the crypto by potting the ancient organism and bringing it home to their concerningly large succulent garden. The cryptobiotic soil was unable to comment on the matter because it does not speak and most of it was crushed.
