**Tape:**

Not only did you say “I got here first”, you also said “I can cure my debilitating finger injury with some sticky string”

**Tick Marks:**

TICK. THE. PROJ. You can tick with impunity by saying: “I better brush these when I’m done.” Brushing is not needed however, just be sure you say this phrase loud enough.

**Bring a dog:**

These things are remarkable. They just fuck up everything in sight. Here is a short list

* Chase off wildlife
* Dig holes
* Dig holes in wildlife
* Biting other climbers
* Shitting

Really any behavior can be excused by the phrase “They are usually so good at the crag.” Just say it loud enough and your loneliness coping mechanism can continue their havoc. Dogs are also very effective in gyms.

**Leave a dog:**

Simply leave your untrained burden of a mistaken purchase at the last place you climbed. Not only will it continue to produce havoc, but now you can spray about your missing dog online.

**Poop:**

Let nature do its work decomposing the aftermath of your vegan acai bowl, low carb power bar, and 12 beers you had yesterday. In the short span of 3 years your paint job will become one with the earth. Just remember, cat holes are for cats and do it within earshot of other climbers.

**Put climbing stickers on everything:**

It’s not litter, because you care about the planet and would never litter. Stick another piece of trash on the buttermilks sign, it will surely never weather and end up scattered in owens valley.
