“Honestly, moving to Tahoe this summer was the best thing I could have done. The climbing is excellent and people are so friendly. I’ve happily adopted the local ethic of shaming climbers from the bay, how dare they come up here and endanger our community.” New local Bridgett Jones said when we visited her two month Airbnb “I’m just so happy to have the chance to tick all of the classics and then move again to be a local somewhere else.”



“This pandemic thing has been a great incentive to climb outdoors more. Even though I’ve got a home wall at my place in Colorado and a home training center in LA, climbing outdoors is way better. As we know, these are impacted areas and I don’t know how much longer they’ll be around, so gotta get while it's good!”



“Since I’m a local now, I am essentially a God among the peasants that travel out here. It’s a truly great time for us locals, we feel even more superior than usual, and I'll be damned if we don’t abuse the hell out of that power.” She said through clenched teeth.



“Well of course I’m going back to LA for the holidays! The cases are so high there, I’m sure they wouldn’t mind a few more.” She said, after being prompted. “I wouldn’t miss the holiday tradition of coughing on grandma. Plus since it's a big city, I can probably manage to get a test before going back to my small town after.”
