“I believe that we all share this planet together, and we have no choice but to coexist! With the exception, of course, of ‘those people’.” Local Boulder, CO man said through clenched teeth. “They are moving here at an alarming rate and forcing their culture on us.”



“When Cali sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems to us. They're bringing drugs, traffic, forest fires, warmer winters, tiny dogs, good looks, and The Red Hot Chili Peppers. And some, I assume, are good people.”



“They don’t even try to assimilate! They are easy to spot, because they don’t even speak our language. They say things like ‘Oof! Yeah, I def bonked and took a fat L, broke both my anks.’ or ‘Yo, dip me in your Monday milk’. I’m not sure what it means, but it sounds criminal. I can’t let my children hear that!”



We can only imagine how exhausting hating Californians must be, given that 1/8th of all Americans are from California. We asked a few Californians what they thought about the hate from Colorado.



“Oh, that’s nice that they think about us! I don’t know the last time I thought about the midwest.” -**Jennifer Brooks** *San Fransisco, CA*



“Is that even a real state? You said it’s shaped like a square? Sounds fake to me.” -**Glen Madison** *South Lake Tahoe, CA*
