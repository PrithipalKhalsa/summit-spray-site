With such a busy Christmas season of binge shopping online deals, a skier can be a hard person to find the perfect gift for. We recently spoke to a cute elderly couple who were looking around for that special something for their ski bum child.



"We heard about 'sending the gnar' after watching some skiing videos online and thought that it could be the perfect gift!" The couple said in our interview with them." So we started to search for a place where we could order some 'gnar' and send it to our favorite skier."



Their 26 year old son has been living in a van for the past 4 years after graduating from college and told his parents that they wouldn't be able to make it home for Christmas this year. "The pow is firing right now and with a pandemic on, can't get sick. There's too much sending to do."



After calling their local post office, they couldn't find any information on whether or not the gnar would fit into a letter sized PO box. "We found a dead end in trying to send our son the 'gnar' so we just bought him a GoPro."
