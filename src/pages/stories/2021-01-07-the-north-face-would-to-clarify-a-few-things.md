“Yeah, we didn’t mean for a coup.” Head North Face marketing strategist and totally fired mother fucker, Ashley Coldman told us when we interviewed her. “We meant it as a vague way to sell child-labored fast fashion to people who didn’t want Trump's wall. But holy fuck, we are having a meeting tomorrow to change it before it becomes a Proud Boy’s chant.”



“Our new working campaign slogan is ‘Walls that don’t physically and metaphorically protect our democracy from domestic terrorists are meant for climbing’. It’s a bit wordy for the smaller sizes so will simply put ‘don’t throw a coup’ on the child clothes.”



Several athletes have already dropped The North Face including climbing legend Moreen Beck. “I can no longer support a company that actively backed this insurrection. I need to look back on my own life and make sure I wasn’t ever involved in a white supremisist overtaking of a free society.”



“We wanted to compete with Patagonia’s “The president stole your land” campaign. We were trying to be vague so we didn’t lose our Montana and Dakota base. Boy, did that backfire or what!”
