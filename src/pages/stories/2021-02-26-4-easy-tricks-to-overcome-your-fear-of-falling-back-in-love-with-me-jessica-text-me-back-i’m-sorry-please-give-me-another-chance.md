1. **Practice often:** Falling is a skill. Since we have been so ‘on again, off again’ the last few years, it must feel like second nature to forget my errors. Don’t wait too long to fall again, or you might raise your standards and not settle for me.


2. **Get a belayer you trust**: I broke your trust before, but it won’t happen again! This time I will remember your birthday and won’t flirt with your sister on our anniversary.


3. **Choose something below your limit**: Like me! You can shoot WAAAYYY higher than me. Literally anyone is a better choice. So clearly I’m the safest bet for a comfortable fall.


4. **Take a deep breath and just let go**: In other words: take me back, I’m so alone without you. I’m in a deep dark shame spiral and I need you to fix me. Forgiving me is a start but also please get back together with me thus acknowledging my atrocities weren’t that bad in the first place.
