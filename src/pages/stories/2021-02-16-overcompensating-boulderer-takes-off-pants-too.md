Local show off Jeffrey ‘future-DILF’ Bradford was 24 tries into his V6 project in the Anza Borrego desert. He had already taken off his beanie, shirt, and fitbit but had one final trick up his sleeve. “I dragged out both my brother and his girlfriend to spot me, so I had to make it at least look like I was trying my hardest to send.” Bradford said as he slowly stripped down to reduce his ounces.



“Another way to show that I’m trying hard is to throw a childish fit once I fall. It shows that climbing this grade isn’t usually this hard for me. That simple trick makes me seem like a V9 climber instead of V6.” Bradford told us before getting shut down yet again on a climb that was clearly too hard for him. We covered our ears in preparations for his wobbler shrieks.

“We just hope he is having fun.” Bradford’s spotters told us. “We just enjoy spending time with Jeffrey, he thinks he needs to impress us with his screaming and stripping. The reality is we didn’t come to climb at all, we just enjoy days like this.”
