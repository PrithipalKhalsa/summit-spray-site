It’s the age old question: length vs girth. We interviewed climbing legend and thicc necked boi Dave Graham to get a professional's opinion. “No one has ever said ‘oh Dave, I wish it was longer’” Dave said before we had a chance to ask him anything. “I just feel like it's what my belayers desire the most ''. When asked who he looked up to the most he said “Usually Sharma as he sends my projects, that's actually why my neck is this way”

Unfortunately pro-climber and prometheus looking motherfucker Adam Ondra was not available for comment. When we approached him he simply let out a high pitched scream, got in his spaceship and returned to his home planet.



We will let the reader decide on this one however. We will be sending out silicone neck molds of both Ondra and Graham. To simulate their screams the fake necks will come with 3 different vibration settings: ‘Try Hard’, ‘Dyno’, and ‘Wobbler’.
