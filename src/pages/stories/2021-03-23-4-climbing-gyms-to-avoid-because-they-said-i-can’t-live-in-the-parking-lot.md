**Movement Climbing + Fitness, Boulder CO**

I was allowed to stay for a couple days until “I was scaring away members” with my morning kegel routine. If I don’t strengthen my pelvic floor I might not be able to hold my pee for days on end once my bottle is full.

**Brooklyn Boulders, NYC**

This place was surprisingly good for street parking! I parked in the red zoned in the front and got towed to a yard outside of the city. Jokes on them though, now I have a place to stay and new friends! I think I’ll call this one Remy after his brother in the ratatouille film.

**Sender One, LA**

I would avoid this gym at all costs. They claim I would “be a liability” and “people have been stabbed right outside our gym before, you should really be careful where you park at night”. How dare they tell me to avoid danger, If people don’t respect me for doing dangerous things then that means my dad was right.

**Planet Granite, SF**

This place is full of total narcs: they called the cops! I thought: “better to ask forgiveness than permission”. I woke up in the middle of the night to the SFPD knocking on my van. He asked me a series of riddles and stole my mattress. When I threatened to file a report they said “Who is going to believe you? It’s my word against yours, and I live in a house.”
