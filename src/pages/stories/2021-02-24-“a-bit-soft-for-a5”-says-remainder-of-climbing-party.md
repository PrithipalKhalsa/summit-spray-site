“I mean we only lost John.” Said the two surviving climbers. Chet and Stacey topped out El Cap via the route *Surgeon General (A5)* on Monday morning, without their third party member John. “An A5 route is supposed to be the most dangerous rating, but I am totally fine. I’m not sure if we can even take this grade, it feels like a stiff A4 at best.” Said Chet who was clearly grief stricken.



“He actually didn’t pass away from a climbing fall.” Stacey informed us. “It turns out the seasonal closures aren’t meant to keep peregrine falcons safe from us, the restrictions are to keep us safe from them. So basically it’s an A4 route with an A6 anchor half way up.” Stacey took a moment to compose herself about her late friend. “I’ll never forget John's last words: ‘Wow these eggs look delicious!’ He had such a way with words.”



We’ve heard that the FA party caught wind of the downgrading attempt and hired a hitman in an attempt to keep the A5 rating. “It’s gonna be A5 one way or another. Whether they are on the wall or off, we need to end what they started.”
