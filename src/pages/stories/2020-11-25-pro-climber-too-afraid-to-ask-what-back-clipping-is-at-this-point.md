We spoke with 35 year old professional climber, Alex Honnold, about what keeps him awake at night.



“Besides the impending sense that whatever I do will fall short of my biggest accomplishment: becoming Kanto League Champion and catching all 151 Pokemon,” Honnold told us from one of the Sprinter vans in his fleet. “My biggest secret is that I’m not sure what ‘back-clipping’ is. No one ever explained it, they just saw me absolutely bone crush any route I touched. People just assumed I already knew. Before I knew it, I was in too deep and it was too late to just ask.”



“Yeah I mean, I know what back-clipping is, I was just making sure you knew.” Honnold started to explain, when we immediately laughed at how dumb he was. “but maybe you could explain it to my wife so she… oh, she already knows?” “I bet my Mom doesn't know… oh, she knows too? I must have already explained it to her so well a bunch of times because I’m so good at doing a back-clip.”



As if that wasn’t embarrassing enough we also found out Honnold also doesn’t know how a 401k works, and we totally know and don’t need anyone to explain it to us. However, we don’t think our mom knows so if you could explain it to her...
