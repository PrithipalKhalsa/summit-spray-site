        <h4>Adam Ondra on La Dura Dura</h4>

        <p>You’re still a carefree adolescent at heart. You don’t care what people think about you, as long as they know you're better than them. You’re a scream that isn’t for power, but as a reminder to the other screechers who’s on top.</p>

        <h4>Adam Ondra Falling on the Salalthe</h4>

        <p>You are courageous but also temperamental. You will bravely try crazy new things and then take your anger out on poor Nico Favresse. You enjoy cool winter days and could never live in a place like Arizona or Florida.</p>

        <h4>Adam Ondra on Silence</h4>

        <p>You are very mature. You know when to hold your tongue to keep friendships alive. Your word has power since it’s used less often. Your yell is no longer a ‘go-to’, but rather a secret back pocket weapon.</p>

        <h4>Adam Ondra on Gioia V16</h4>

        <p>You are the nervous shy type. Although your sound is, perhaps, ear bludgeoning you only use it in front of one or two other people. When you show people your send video later, it will be on mute.</p>

        <h4>Adam Ondra Attempts to Send his First 9a</h4>

        <p>You are excited, wide eyed, and maybe a Pisces? Trying new things, failing and learning is right in your Q-zone. You are a lifelong student who isn’t afraid of getting their hands dirty.You are a moron.</p>
