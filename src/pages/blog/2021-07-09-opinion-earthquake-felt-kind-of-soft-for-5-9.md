Tahoe was hit by a 5.9 earthquake on July 8th, 2021. Climbers immediately flocked to social media to comment that their wall of pristine cams hadn't fallen off the pegs where they’ve been racked for 3 years now. No dust was knocked off the kneepad purchased in 2012 for the mega proj. And the weekly commute to the gym also felt pretty normal. The only effect felt was a decent excuse to not go for a run this year.\

Seismologists said this type of earthquake will become more and more common as “humans continue to fuck shit up on earth,” noting that the blatant disregard of fracking dangers continue to pose a threat. The seismologist also mentioned that the only thing softer than this 5.9 quake was the Tahoe route that was hit, Empath (5.15a?), that, with elementary jamming technique, matches the grade of this quake.\

The Tahoe crew swears that the next earthquake will be 5.8 and totally fuck up their long time “local” foes in the bay. With a previous earthquake in 1989, magnitude 6.9 (nice), creating a sweet climbing area along the coast line. 



A few opinions from the locals:



“Most of my houses are still standing.” -Billionaire tech mogul Tommy Shoelace on his block of spare Tahoe vacation homes.



“Didn’t really notice it.” - Lake Tahoe

“The rating of this earthquake is kinda the ultimate statement about what is going on in the sport right now.” - John Long lost in the Tahoe wilderness
