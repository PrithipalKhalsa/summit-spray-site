The CDC made a few adjustments to their covid-19 guidelines to include “dumb fucks who can’t shut up”.



“It came to our attention our Covid-19 recommendations did not cover unsolicited beta sprayers. The six foot rule works well enough for corona aerosols.” The CDC announced in a white house press conference on Tuesday “However, for something as grotesque as your babbling dribble we recommended at least 40 feet. As an alternative to a cloth mask we also ask that you wear this mask”:

“You can also make one at home with a sock and some tape. Visit our website for an instructional video featuring Martha Stewart.”



The press conference went on for quite some time with Dr. Fauci screaming some abseninties we won’t quote here.

“She doesn’t need your beta, this is literally her warm up, you personified pair of rental shoes!”. Fauci yelled as he was winding down his verbal roasting. “Just shut up and go back to loudly doing pull ups in your climbing shoes and harness.”
