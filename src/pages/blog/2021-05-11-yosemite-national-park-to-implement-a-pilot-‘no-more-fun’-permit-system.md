Yosemite National Park announced on Friday that it would begin strictly regulating the jolly merrymaking that was taking place in the valley.



All visitors planning to partake in jubilant recreation must first obtain a permit. The permit process will be so draining and painful, all joy will be sucked from your visit and replaced with a sadness reminiscent of when your mom forgot to sign the permission slip for your 8th grade field trip. On the other hand, all visitors planning to partake in gloomy discomfort must also first obtain an alternative, but equally painful, permit. 



Permits can be obtained from the hours of 6:00am-6:08am from the evasive park ranger, Steve. Steve can be contacted through a series of complex riddles, angry voicemails, and a 2 foot front door surrounded by bees. 



Along with this pilot permit system, the National Park Service has also introduced several new needlessly overreaching park regulations to minimize the impact of spirited recreation. Such rules include ‘no reading trail signs’, ‘no yogi bear impersonations’, and a ‘3 wipes per visitor’ rule.



These permits for the pilot program will be free…. for now.
