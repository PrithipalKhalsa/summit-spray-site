REI SoHo voted 86% yes for unionization last night, making it the first unionized store. In light of these recent events, the corporation is doubling down on its union-busting efforts by removing ‘Co-op’ from the store’s name.



“It was purely symbolic anyway. REI is a co-op in the same way a tomato is technically a fruit. The store isn’t owned by the employees and customers. It’s owned by me!” Eric Artz told us in a video interview while bathing in crumpled up hundred dollar bills. “So now by removing ‘co-op’ from the name, we are being a little more honest. Plus a lot more anti-union.”



“Co-op was never meant to be a word taken up by the employees.” Megan Behrbaum told us from the same bathtub full of cash. “It was meant to help the customer feel an obligation to keep coming back, even though we are totally fucking them over. Sort of how a toxic work environment calls the employees family. I believe they call it trauma bonding.”



“We were too public with our union busting. The next store that tries to unionize will get a visit from Tony and his ‘pals’. They camp outside employees' homes and make cricket sounds with megaphones. They usually work for Bezos so they must be good!”
