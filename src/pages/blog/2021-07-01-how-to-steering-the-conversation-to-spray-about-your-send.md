Picture this: you just sent your first 5.12 over the weekend but your gym crush is droning on and on about her dying father. Narts! Will you ever get to mention your greatness? Are you Worried the conversation might not turn your way? Checkout these tips to help you spray about every nook and cranny of your significant ascent.



1. **Find something in common with the current conversations and link it to your send**

Example:

“*Yeah my father was a smoker for 35 years, the doctors are doing everything they can but it doesn’t look good.*”

“*You don’t say… Hey, that reminds me of when I sent Black Lung, rated 5.12a over this past weekend...*”



2. **Pretend to get a phone call from a reputable climber**

Example:

“*Yeah, I’m not sure if we can make the mortgage payments anymor-*”

“*Sorry one sec, I’m getting a phone call… Hello… Why yes I did send Genesis rated 5.12a in Rifle over the weekend... Well thank you for the phone call, renowned proclimber Alex Puccio...*”



3. **Suffer through their send story**

This one is not ideal. I highly recommend earplugs, or standing near a big gym fan. Once they are finally done, it’s your turn and you can tell them what a special little boy you are as if they are actually listening. Once they understand the full picture of how unarguably superior you are, allow them to end the conversation with an awkward “I gotta try this new set” or a “we should get out and climb sometime.”
