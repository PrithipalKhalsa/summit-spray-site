La Sportiva athlete, and anime character, Brittany Goris was seen taking a shift as a crossing guard close to a moab middle-school, sources confirm. She was wearing her usual outfit: aggressively colorful La Sportiva clothes that require eclipse glasses to look directly at.



“I was just walking to a mechanic from my broken-down van when they handed me this stop sign.” Goris said when we asked about her career change. “It felt like I was finally rejoined with my missing piece. Like this had always been my true calling. My arm feels… complete.”



We spoke to a few drivers who had stopped. “I started slowing down five miles back. I thought a paint truck had crashed into a flower stand. Nope, it was just a tall bright lady. She was holding a stop sign in one hand and a tip jar in the other. I tossed in 20 dollars because it smelled like she needed it.”



“I’ve never seen someone so passionate about stopping cars and yelling at children.” Goris’ new boss Nacey told us. “We also need a new P.E. coach, I think she would be perfect. I’m not sure if she knows anything about fitness, but she sure can put the fear of god into these kids with only a few words!”
