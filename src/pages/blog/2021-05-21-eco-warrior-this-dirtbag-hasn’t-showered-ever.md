“I’ve always thought of myself as an environmental role model.” Peter Daniels is a 23 year old eco pioneer from Albuquerque, New Mexico. He hasn’t bathed since his womb days and has no plans to shower anytime soon. “My parents raised me this way. Rest in peace, mom and pop. They recently passed away from a variety of easily preventable parasitic worms.”

“I do get clean, I’m not afraid of water or anything. I just use natural showers like rain, and city storm drains.” Daniels informed us. “I don’t use artificial soaps either. I exfoliate with natural soaps such as sand, rocks, and charcoal. I freshen up with natural deodorant and toothpaste as well. Such as salt crystals, flowers, and the sun” 

We struggled to get a good look at him through our watering eyes and the sun reflecting off his greasy skin. Daniels also informed us Yosemite Valley was his favorite climbing destination, which would explain the greasy texture of the rock. Once the interview was over we all took several showers for several hours, attempting to rid ourselves of Daniels' pungent odors. Essentially negating all of Daniels' hard environmental work.
