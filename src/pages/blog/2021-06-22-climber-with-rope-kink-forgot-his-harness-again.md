Jimmy ‘it’s not that weird’ Douglass showed up to the crag again conveniently forgetting his climbing harness and wearing a suspicious amount of leather. Jimmy has a large online presence as both a die hard rock climber and as a major rope daddy.



“That’s the tenth time this week.” Jimmy’s climbing partner Marcus told us. “I mean it’s obvious he likes it better. The way he mutters to himself and grinds his teeth while he belays. I’m not here to kink shame, but he should just own it instead of making lame excuses every time. Yesterday, he said a family of racoons mugged him on the way to the crag. They allegedly only took his harness and the ass part of his pants.”



“It’s not an excuse! Those racoons came out of nowhere and stole my property. If I ever find them I will get revenge and steal their limbs!” He explained to us as he tied a complex rope harness in 6.23 seconds. “Anyway, I keep my climbing life and nightlife separate. I even have two separate instagram accounts. One for rope play and one for playing on ropes.”
