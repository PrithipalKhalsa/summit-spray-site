“I’ve made mistakes I’m not proud of, but this year I’m turning a new leaf and will make mistakes I AM proud of. For example, accidentally filing my “thirty year old daughter” as a dependent and also maybe some weird looking w2s.” We sat down with reformed New Years resolutionist Ted Bill Jeff Tom Goodman.

“I used to be called ‘couch potato’, ‘a bad father’ and ‘wanted for arson’. Well, I’m putting all of that behind me and starting fresh.” Tom informed us while shredding important looking documents. “This year is going to be different: I’ll go to the gym, lose weight, stop shaving, dye my hair, get a new phone number, swap license plates with a car at CVS, and maybe start working on that novel.”
