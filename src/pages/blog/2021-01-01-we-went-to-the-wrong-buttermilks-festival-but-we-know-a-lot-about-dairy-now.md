Somewhere along the 25 hour drive to Wisconsin we should have realized that this probably wasn’t a sick highball festival. We just thought maybe there was another stash of buttermilk granite boulders in the midwest or something.



It turns out that “The Buttermilks” are also a dairy product, not just a place to abandon your dog. This also explains the overly crunchy scones we made last week.



We interviewed dairy farmer Rick Terry because he was the closest sounding to professional climber, Nik Berry. “Buttermilk is the liquid that is leftover after churning butter. These days we just mutate low-fat milk till it kinda tastes and looks the same. Buttermilk yields a better flavor, better rise, and better texture in baked goods.” Rick begrudgingly told us. x



To put it into climbing terms: Buttermilk is like the friction labs of the baking world. If you are baking with just milk, then you and your cake will be textureless sacks of crap. Similarly, if you use metolius chalk on your proj, your pastry will be ‘dry but like, not in the way you want’.



Rick didn’t really like us or our bad analogy. He then gave us some useful information about where we could stuff it.
