Are you being lied to? Is the next hold the kind of jug you can pour water into or nothing more than a loose potato chip glued to the rock? We spoke with top geologist Dr Caleb Thomas who is currently doing research at Fresno State University to determine if your friend is a dirty rotten sandbagger. 



“After years of research we are almost no closer to when we started.” Dr Thomas lamented to us. “Our best guess is still that your friend is using your ascent to boost their own ego. Their intention is to provoke a ‘You think that’s a jug?!’ after totally eating shit from your inability to hold onto to their lies. Our other hypothesis is that your friend is just a smooth brain, knuckle dragging, sticky hand, first grader who hasn’t grasped the concept of what a jug is.”



“After many test subjects we have found a few that seem to be telling the truth and the next hold is indeed a USA Climbing certified jug. These individuals tend to be more humble and not total assholes like Steve who sandbagged me last Tuesday.”
