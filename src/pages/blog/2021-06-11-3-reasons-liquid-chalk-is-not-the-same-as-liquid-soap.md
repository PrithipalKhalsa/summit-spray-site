A drying rack full of chalked dishes was the first indication that a mistake had been made. After Friction Labs made ridiculously audacious claims about their liquid chalk killing everything it touches, including your hands (thanks calluses) our research team tested to find out what other uses liquid chalk had for cleaning. While the list of reasons is endless, the top three reasons liquid chalk is a bad soap replacement all come to the ridiculous white residue it leaves behind after cleaning.

**1.** Incriminating at a crime scene, unlike liquid soap, which washes off after rinsing your hands, liquid chalk seems to look an AWFUL lot like the chalked outline at a crime scene that you may or may not be fleeing. You got greedy at an REI and now they’re chalking out the stolen Power Beans and one size small arc-teryx jacket that you just happen to be wearing. While they’re laying down the chalk it seems to look almost identical to the white residue on your hands. While this shouldn’t work for any sort of legal action, cops have acted on far less.\

**2.** Dishes are ruined. Our researchers are actually just one person with, like, 5 dishes. All of those dishes are now COVERED in chalk. The one time this month Steve decided to do dishes aligned with our testing period and now Steve has white chalk all over his two plates, one bowl, and two mugs. Still a flavor improvement from last month's caked on “chili week” but not that good for dishes.

**\
3.** No matter how much you use, the chalk is always there. You keep washing and washing and washing trying to use liquid chalk as liquid soap, getting it off your hands seems to be an eternal trap where every new layer is thicker and more powerful than the last. Friction is increasing, your hands are starting to experience drag as they stick to the air molecules. You are slow, but stickier than ever. And NO MATTER WHAT IT WON'T GO AWAY.
