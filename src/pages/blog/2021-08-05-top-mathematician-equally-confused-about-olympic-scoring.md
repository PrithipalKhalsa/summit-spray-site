During our exclusive summit spray olympic viewing party, we consulted with a trusted mathematician to figure out exactly how the olympic scoring worked for “Sport Climbing.” During the interview, our mathematician told us “I have absolutely no idea what’s going on here, what is a zone hold? Why were they racing before? Where are the handjams?”

After a brief rundown of climbing knowledge, the “Big Dr. Smart Man” (BDSM for short) dropped some knowledge bombs, “So if Nathaniel got 3 in speed climbing, it will combine with his 8a.nu score, but since the spanish don’t use 8a, and go exclusively by the ‘sharma system’ they’ll need to convert to top moonboard rankings. All of this will be multiplied by their speed score, but the speed score will be multiplied by .05 to reduce its weight in the overall score cuz no one gives a shit about speed climbing. This will give us the preliminary number as our finalists go into sport climbing, but since the entire olympic event is called sport climbing, this is now called ‘clippy clippy don’t fall climbing.’ Results from all cumulative karmic actions will be added last and it will all once again come down to how well you did in the 3rd grade.”



As the lead event came to the final contender it was looking very clear from the calculations that literally anyone other than Alex Megos was going to win Gold, and finally, Alberto Ginés López took home the first olympic gold in “Sport/Bouldering/Speed/Aid/Ice/Mixed/Top-Rope climbing”

Congratulations to all the Olympic athletes who competed in this incredible debut event.
