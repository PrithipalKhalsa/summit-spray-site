A recently published study by the United States Food and Drug Administration suggests that climbing makes up only one part of a complete and balanced personality. The study shows that other traits, such as compassion, perseverance, self-awareness, creativity, and humor are required to make the complete personality necessary to be a well adapted human. The study also shows that possessing only a combination of personality traits under the climbing umbrella, such as aid climbing, bouldering, trad, ice, alpine and #vanlife still does not make a balanced and fully functional adult.



The FDA warns that failure to have a personality that has more than one aspect may lead to long term social and health consequences. The study showed that individuals whose personality revolved solely around climbing were shown to have lower social skills, critical thinking skills, and standards of living compared with those who pursued more than one thing in life. The study did however show that specific skills were stronger among the one dimensional climber group including gear placement, topo map reading, and dumpster diving. According to FDA scientist Brett Conelly, “people who have personalities not entirely centered around a single contrived sport tend to have more fulfilling careers, relationships, and lives in general.”



Summit Spray speculates that climbers would be shaken by this study if they decide to stop blabbering about their projects for one second and read the goddamn news.
