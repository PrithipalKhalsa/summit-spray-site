We have all been there: you arrive at an anchor near the end of the pitch. “Surely this can’t be the anchor. It’s essentially useless!” You proceed to hesitantly climb up and down for the next 30 minutes searching for something from this century. 8 topos, 3 mountain project forums and 2 shouting matches with your belayer later, you finally settle for Warren Harding’s pitons made from razor blades and guitar strings. You whimper a sad “off belay” and slowly start hauling, you pray that the extra cribbage board, whiskey, and cold brew aren’t the extra ounces that cut your adventure short. You tell yourself a myriad of phrases and reassure your sanity. Probably fine… Probably fine. A few pitches later you will forget. Since you have the memory of a strawberry, you will not relay this danger to anyone else and recall the route as being ‘surprisingly mellow’.

Here are our top picks for big wall anchors that are most likely fine:



"People heavier than me have used them, why would they fail now?"

"It’s just rusting on the outside, the actual bolt part thing is definitely fine I bet."

“Well, there are so many pieces that *something* will hold.”

“The pieces are equalized fairly well, plus we only have one haulbag.”

“I’m pretty sure I’ve used worse anchors. Plus these are my pins, I just bought them.”
