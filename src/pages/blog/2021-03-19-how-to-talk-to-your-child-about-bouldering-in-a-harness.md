By child, we don’t even mean your offspring, but anyone who boulders in a harness is clearly a child in the eyes of the climbing community. There are a few constructive ways to address this awkward faux pa at the gym and the situation should be handled delicately to not push your child away from the sport. Start with a gentle “What the fuck are you doing you look like an absolute gumby” and after you’ve said this in the safety of your mind, set aside your giant fucking ego and recommend they try bouldering with added mobility.

Clearly, the person bouldering in a harness is new to the sport, take this as an opportunity to jerk off how much you know, and flex out on how humble you are by politely addressing the potential safety concerns for the climber and others around by having a belay device and locking carabiner hanging on a gear loop.  

Here’s your gold star, you’re a great climber with loads of knowledge, now act like an adult and provide some gentle, constructive feedback in a supportive manner to help foster a cool community, you judgemental fuck.
