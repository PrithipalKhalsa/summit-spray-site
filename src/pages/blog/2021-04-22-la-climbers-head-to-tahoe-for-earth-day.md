Self proclaimed environmental steward, Bill Jones, made the trek out to Lake Tahoe this weekend in celebration of mother earth and the climate. Accompanied by his 12 pals and their vans. “LA isn’t really a place where picking up litter is going to make me feel good. Donner Summit on the other hand, now that is something I can post about.”



“It feels good to give back to mother earth. We’ll stewartize this area, then head to Indian Creek next weekend to give back to the planet over there.” Bill Jones boasted loudly so everyone at the crag was aware of his superiority. “Our version of helping the planet is going climbing and doing the absolute bare minimum by picking up most of the trash we littered.”



We asked about the impact of their gas guzzling caravan to any area around a 500 mile radius. “Actually our vans are super gas efficient. 19MPG, if you can believe that! It would have been 20 but I just HAD to have those granite countertops. Plus, I’m pretty sure diesel burns clean now or something. I read an instagram picture about how it’s better for the planet.”
