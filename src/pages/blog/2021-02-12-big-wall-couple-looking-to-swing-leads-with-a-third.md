“This Valentine’s day we wanted to mix things up a bit. Every year it's just the two of us and our portaledge definitely sleeps three people. We have heard that it can be more messy with three people and much communication is needed.” Bronwyn Hodgins and Jacob Cook are two ‘sponsored’ rock climbers looking to add a third to the mix for their valentine’s week ascent of El Capitan in Yosemite Valley.



“It just gets so boring when it’s just the two of us. He’ll just silently work away at the pitch for an hour and then I hear a big woo-hoo and he says ‘I’m finished.’” Bronwyn Hodgins lamented about her underperforming partner.



“We feel like it might be more fun, and warm, to add someone to our portaledge at night. Plus, if I can’t finish a pitch, we’ll have another person who can help finish the job.” Jacob Cook said winking so much we had to offer him eye drops.



We were in a rush to leave for the valentines date we totally had later that night. However we left them one of our interns, who Hodgins and Cook had a particular interest in. We’ll check back with her for an update tomorrow, or maybe next week if they get lucky.
