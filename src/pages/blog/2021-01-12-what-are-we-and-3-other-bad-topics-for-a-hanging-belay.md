Take this unique opportunity to absolutely demolish a friendship with a terrible conversation your partner cannot physically escape from. These are a few of our recent favorites when we want to burn our bridges:



“What are we?”

This is a great one, it forces them to define the relationship 9 inches from your face in a high stress situation. Regardless of this going poorly or well, it’s gonna be so fucking wierd that you asked them. It will likely stay in their head forever and keep them up at night for years to come! What a huge success!



“I miss you”

This one is for the ex-es. Several months after your break up, invite your ex (now ‘friend’) to climb. At the pitch 3 anchor, stare them in the eyes and obliterate the healing that you both had to put forward to reach a mature understanding. Absolutely fucking end your chances at still being friends later. Use 3 little words to make the situation feel monstrously unsafe for them.



“Wanna see a photo of my kids”

Absolutely fucking not Steve, your new born twins look like uncooked banana bread. Let them sit and cool before you show me your placenta covered burdons.



Talking about your recent colonoscopy

Steve, what is wrong with you? Why would this be a topic of conversion in any situation?! I do not want to hear about your G-spot or about how the doctors ‘just don’t know yet’.
