Tired of climbing at Planet Granite with all of the normies? Want to learn how to get access to the secret gym? The climbing gym staff are eager to help you get to the cool spots, as one of the “with-it” climbers. The secret menu is simple, just commit all of your free time to the climbing gym, and strike up a conversation with the front desk staff, who are required to stay at the front desk.



Gaining access to the private kilter board with JWebb and DaWoods? 3,000ft of Alex Honnold’s soloing gym? These are just a few cool new spots you can go to if you spend too much time at the gym. Simply say the words, “hey, I know I’m a 28 year old dirtbag, but can I get the student discount on my membership?” or other funny quips like, “I know it’s my first time here, but I’ve been leading for a few years, can’t I skip the lead test?”



Once you’ve really worn down the front desk team, finish it off by spraying about your local project. You’ll get an expedited entry for the next time you go to the gym. By spending a quick 20 to 30 minutes telling an employee about your new microbeta, it will ensure you get ushered past a busy front desk the next time you show your loud, spray lord, smelly face, Kyle.
