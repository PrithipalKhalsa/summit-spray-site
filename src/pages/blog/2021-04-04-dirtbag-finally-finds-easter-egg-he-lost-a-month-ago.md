“I didn’t really notice the smell until people started parking further and further away from me.” Erik Sanderson said through watering eyes as he displayed his prized egg to us. “Like a frog getting boiled in water I just didn’t notice I was stinkier than usual.”

 Sanderson’s mystery egg was found this morning wedged between his mattress and the rickety bed frame of his itty bitty 2010 Ford Transit van. It was predicted that it had fallen in the kitchen, rolled into the living room, landed in the bedroom and nestled safely in the perfect easter hiding spot.



“I was so afraid I was never going to be found.” The egg commented “Sanderson is super careless and so stinky already I thought I was done for! Lucky for me he just ran out of eggs, so I think becoming an omelet is in my future.”



We had to cut the interview short because our mom found out we weren’t in church on Easter Sunday. In the spirit of the holiday we hid 8 more eggs in Erik Sanderson’s van before we drove off.
