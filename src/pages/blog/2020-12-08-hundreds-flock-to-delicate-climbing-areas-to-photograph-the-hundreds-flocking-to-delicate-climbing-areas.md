Hundreds flock to delicate climbing areas to photograph the hundreds flocking to delicate climbing areas. As more gyms close, more people find themselves with no alternative but to go to the most popular climbing area within their small covid radius of 10ish hours of driving. A renewed sense of justice and social awareness has made people even more conscious of their impact on rock climbing areas. Public shaming of impactful crowds has become a popular, easy rest day activity.



“It’s so easy to take a rest day and hike up to the top of the happies with 19 of my closest friends and their dogs, we all drove separately to avoid covid, but there were so many other cars in the parking lot!” A concerned local Bishop/LA climber told us.



In these trying times, we must do our part to speak out about people flocking to our local climbing areas as we move local climbing areas every two months with our sweet new remote gig. Please keep spreading awareness. Also, if anyone wants to climb in Vegas let me know, I’m here till January. Then I’m off to another five star destination.
