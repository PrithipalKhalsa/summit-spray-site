Local nervous wreck, Doug Peters, woke up early Wednesday morning feeling inspired and that his life will never amount to anything meaningful. “My therapist says that I use running as a form of self harm. Needless to say I am looking for a new therapist.” Doug told us, as he stomped around in his kitchen at a break-neck speed. “Running isn’t about my health anymore, I need people to remember my name after I die. If they forget my name, my life will have meant nothing. I’ve got plenty to keep me motivated such as honey bee endangerment and deforestation. Not to mention my mounting student debt. Don’t even get me started about Stonehenge”

To get a better perspective on the athlete's wellbeing we spoke to Doug’s severely sleep deprived roommate Katie. “He wont stop. He’s been pacing for 8 days straight. I called the cops but they said it technically isn't illegal. He isn’t trying to break any records with this marathon. When Doug isn’t moving, he starts thinking about the climate crisis again.”

The trophies are piling up in the mailbox along with desperate letters from concerned family members. Katie has considered calling the authorities again to, at the very least, have cops show up hours late and shrug passively.
