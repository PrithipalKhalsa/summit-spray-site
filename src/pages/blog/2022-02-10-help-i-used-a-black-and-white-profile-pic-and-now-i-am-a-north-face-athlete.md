“Just when I thought my life couldn’t get any worse!” Henry Spoon lamented from his humble ten square foot apartment in Boulder, CO. Henry works as an artisan grass cutter. He doesn’t do it for the money and can’t even afford a colored camera. On Sunday, he uploaded a new profile picture to instagram, on Monday, he had ten thousand followers and a North Face Sponsorship.



We were able to catch him in between interviews with Cedar Wright. “I’m not angry, just disappointed that I didn’t see this coming. Really, I’m to blame for not knowing the North Face talent scout doesn’t know the difference between a professional athlete and a white dude with a high exposure film camera in Boulder.”



“I didn’t want to get involved in a sweatshop, fast-fashion, faux-environmental company.” Henry pleaded as Cedar packed him a bag for his upcoming Antarctica expedition. “Now they are making a feature film about me. They are dressing me in new clothes every shot and then immediately burning them.”



We tried to interview Cedar since he was in the room but all he kept saying was “Stoked”, “Hell Yeah”, and then repeating his own name over and over again like a pokemon. “Cedar Wright, Cedar Wright, Cedar Wright.”
