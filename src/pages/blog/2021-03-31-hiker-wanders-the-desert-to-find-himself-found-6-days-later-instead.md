“He was half-way through reading Into the Wild.” Jim Farly said about his late roommate. “I told him he should definitely read the rest of the book before he left.” Soon to be deceased, Bill Remy left late last Tuesday morning heading into the Mojave desert alone. He was believed to be intoxicated. Aimlessly wandering under the influence of ‘finding himself’, ‘forging his own path’, and ‘like just living life man, you know without all these phones and artificial distractions. Just like, ya know, really living, out there man’.

He was found by Mojave search and rescue Monday afternoon. “The cause of death is unknown, but our best guess is that once he ran out of water he sought help from the local wildlife.” Local law enforcement had told us. “The jackrabbits around here are common criminals and con artists. We think it's likely he was tricked into giving away his personal information, maybe his social security number and credit cards. Once they had this information they led him into a trap and ate him.” 

“Yeah that makes sense, Bill was always so gullible.” His roommate said “I could see him being tricked into dying by a gang of little rabbits. He wasn’t really street-smart. Actually he wasn’t book smart either. If I’m being honest he was really an all around smooth brainer.”
