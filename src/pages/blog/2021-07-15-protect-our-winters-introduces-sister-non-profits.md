As winter becomes another victim of climate change, Protect Our Winters or POW has branched out to a slightly more sustainable business model of ‘saving the oceans’ and ‘protecting the environment’.



“We have been pouring our funding into saving as much snow as possible. So far we have 20,000 fridges holding snow to the brim for the coming warm winter seasons.” Jeremy Jones told us from his vacation home in Antarctica where the last vestiges of snow are held. “That being said, our POW shareholders don’t think ‘saving winter’ is a sustainable business model. Oceans and the Earth as whole, will last a few years longer than winter seasons. We are also hoping that the ‘subtle’ names will bring attention to the waste in the ocean and encourage people to water trees.”



“Well I’m a dad now.” Tommy “daddy” Caldwell informed us for the 8th time in two minutes. “So now I really care about the future of the planet. If my kids don’t have winter, I can at least try to preserve the earth. Although, the oceans are kind of a lost cause at this point. Plus we don’t have oceans in Colorado, I only know about them through the books I read to my kids. Did I mention that I was a dad?”
