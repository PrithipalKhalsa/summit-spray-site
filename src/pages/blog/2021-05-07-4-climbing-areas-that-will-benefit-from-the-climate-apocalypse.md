The death of the planet isn't all bad! Here are our new favorite climbing areas!

1. **Baffin Island**: Now a year round climbing destination this tropical paradise is perfect for anyone looking to relive the days of old, before the year where the cliffs in Yosemite valley turned back into magma and melted. No longer riddled with dangerous polar bears, or any wildlife, it can be a safe family friendly climbing destination. Just be careful not to stumble onto Cyborg Bezos’ evil lair. He won’t hurt you directly but he will employ you. You're used to peeing into bottles right?
2. **The Climbing Gym**. This is one place where you won’t have to wear your daily gas mask. It includes filtered Indoor Air™ and free, that's right FREE, water. Climbing gyms now attract a larger audience than just climbers. People from all over pay for memberships because of the commodification of basic survival amenities. It’s always a good thing when more money comes into the sport.
3. **Mars**: Colonized by rich people who couldn’t stand to be on the same planet as the poors, Mars is an oasis of first ascents. Also, a literal oasis compared to most of the earth. The Mars ice park also provides the best (and only) ice around. 
4. **The Himalaya**: Sorry ice climbers, just like free water and ‘doing the right thing’, your shimmering glaciers are a thing of the past. Millions of little Yosemite style valleys were exposed when the ice melted. So you can climb big walls to your heart’s content while the weight of humanity bares down on you. You can’t sleep well at night anymore. You are plagued with thoughts like ‘what if I had bought a prius’.
