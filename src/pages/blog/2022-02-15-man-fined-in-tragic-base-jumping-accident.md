Yosemite officials say 39-year-old Henry Hoots was fined in a BASE jumping accident after doing a sick flip off El Cap. BASE jumping stands for Bone, Arm, Spine and Eye, and participants of the extreme sport launch their descent from tall objects using wingsuits or parachutes.



The ranger that ticketed Henry told us the flip was not very sick and that it wouldn’t be tolerated in the park.



“While BASE jumping is illegal in national parks, I usually don’t ticket people because it's so fucking rad.” The ranger informed us while writing up tickets to passing wildlife. “This particular individual was so lame, I had no choice. Way too much flailing and screaming. He didn’t even pull his chute! That’s the coolest part!”



“I could have lost my job if I didn’t give him a $5,000 ticket. Henry was an experienced jumper with over fifteen and a half jumps under his belt. Experts like Henry should know better. I think this will teach him a lesson and he might behave better in the future.”



Henry Hoots was unavailable for comment at this time.
