After the release of the Reel Rock 16, ‘Barefoot’ Charles Albert has inspired everyone he shouldn’t have. Everyone from wooks who don’t own shoes, to dirtbags who forgot what a shower is. They are coming for your boulders. They won’t stop until they get bored and fixate on something else. So here are a few clever ways to protect your local boulders from fungus riddled hippies. 



**Buy a megaphone and announce that the boulders are closed**

Anyone can buy a megaphone. It gives your word instant authority. Legally, they have to listen to whatever you say.



**Take off one of their toes as a warning**

In wook culture, toes grow back after being separated from the body, as they are 60% lizard. It will make it harder for them to climb that day.



**Offer them acid**

It is disrespectful in wook and dirtbag culture to refuse acid. They have no choice but to accept. A double or triple dose is recommended as they likely had a tab for breakfast already.



**Show them something shiny**

A colorful crystal or weird looking charm is ideal for this. They will whisper to themselves about chakras, auras and stars for hours.



**Play Peek-a-boo with them**

Wooks and dirtbags have no object permanence due to the propane leaks on their vans. Playing peak-a-boo with them will distract them from climbing for the entire day.
