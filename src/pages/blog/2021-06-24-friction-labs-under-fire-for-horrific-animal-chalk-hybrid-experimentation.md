Friction Laboratories is in the mits of a PR blunder! A recent whistleblower has unearthed the embarrassing secret of unholy grotesque crimes against all that is sacred. “The experimentations led us to the driest tech we have today. Every ape on our packaging is also in our packaging.” Said our anonymous informant, Jessica Doodle, who is a current lab tech at the company. 



“We did amazing work in the beginning, but it was never dry enough. The shareholders wanted dryer, always dryer. At some point we crossed a line that we couldn’t come back from. One time, we taught one of the experiments to speak english. It only said 2 words over and over again: ‘end me’. So we later tried again with a dictionary.”



Friction Labs recently made a public acknowledgment after its whoopsie daisy was leaked:

“We know some rumors were recently spread around about our chalk, but we want to reassure our customers that our chalk contains less than 2% of any animal. Any other rumours about animal experimentation are none of your business, stay out of it. You like your dry chalk, but can’t handle the ugly truth? Grow up, the world is built with blood.”
