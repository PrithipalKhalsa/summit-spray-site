Millions of years of evolution went into creating your body and its self healing process. But jeez talk about slow. You can’t wait 2 months for that severed tendon to heal. Here are 5 ways to tape your weak little fingers and what it says about you.



1. **X tape**: This one says “Climbing is not a ‘healthy lifestyle’ for me. I’ve based my entire personality and friendships on cranking. I’m afraid to take time off to heal because I might have to face myself.”

2. **H tape**: This is for the ones who believe they know better than their bodies and the doctors who advise rest. H stands for hubris

3. **The Gauntlet**: Wow, you don’t warm up at all do you. How did you break all of them!? This tape job is for the attention seeker and anyone with a god complex who is collecting infinity stones.

4. **40**: Eh your fingers are fucked and you can’t climb. You might as well get shit faced and piss yourself. Nothing else matters anyway.

5. **Buddy tape**: Everyone needs a friend. Especially you. You are such a loser. Your fingers don’t even like each other, you have to force a friendship with tape.
