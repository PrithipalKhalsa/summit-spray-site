Daniel Woods spent his winter proving just how incredible an athlete he really is. This superstar took the time to change sports entirely, signing onto the Las Vegas Raiders as the best punter in the city. Taking a break from his primary sport of being generally reckless, AND his secondary sport of rock climbing, Dan Woods said punting was a nice change of pace.



The entire event took place over a series of 13 weeks and in an even stranger twist, a 6’4” NFL star joined the ranks of the hundreds of people who have climbed Sleepwalker (V16). The NFL star noted that although he was in rental shoes, the big holds were pretty easy to reach, and with the ~50 send videos by anyone passing through Black Velvet canyon the moves were easy to figure out. 



Dan Woods returned to climbing with an astounding V17 send, shocking everyone as we realized he could in fact count to 17. Dan decided he would no longer be punting, and said he’d be retiring to work as an American Spirits spokesperson.
