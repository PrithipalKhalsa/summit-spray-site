We understand themed weddings are a crime against humanity and a violation of the Geneva convention. Seriously, how could you do that to your own mother. That’s why we were ecstatic to be not invited to Linda and Susan’s wedding. Sure, we love them, but we can’t stand hearing vows like “When we started this belaytionship it was chossy...” or “We will send the cruxes of this marriage together”. We would prefer a knife stab.



Thankfully, the brides to be understand the severity of their actions and will not take their family with them. They sent out these nice un-invites to inform us.

*Dear friends and family,*



*Against every wish of literally everyone we know, we are having a climbing themed wedding, #LindaSusanGetGirthHitched2021. This is the official not-invite for you, and your +1! Save the date! The ceremony will only contain us and the officiant. Anyone else that shows up to the wedding will be shot on site. No witnesses.*



*Our Love,*

*Linda and Susan*

When we called them up to ask about their big day. “We are going to wear our solutions to the 5.9 altar. Oh and the bouquet is made of cams and our dentists business card for when we throw it.” Needless to say, we think they made the best of a horrible choice.
