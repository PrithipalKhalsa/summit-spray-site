title: Peregrines Ticketed for Violating Nesting Closures

description: Local nesting closures have been one way outdoor enthusiasts stay
  in good graces with land managers and park authorities. By NPS’ finally taking
  action, peregrine falcons will no longer interfere with peregrine falcon
  nesting, which has been a struggle as old as time. Hopefully with these new
  restrictions, we’ll see closures decrease due to peregrines not being able to
  nest. Big win for climbing and for NPS.

Peregrine Falcons have been ignoring and blatantly violating nesting closures on cliffs all over the US since closures were created. Everyone heard the rumors of peregrines hanging out on cliffs that were intended to be closed, with the age old “I’m sure they just didn’t read the signs,” or “How could they read the signs they’re fucking birds for christ sake, get this mic out of my face.” NPS has finally stepped up, slapping hefty fines on these birds as they descended from their cliff-side junk show, sometimes even going as far as to leave citations on their matching vespas at the base of the climbs.\

We all know that park rangers are on their shit when it comes to understanding situations outside of their area of expertise. They’ve made responsible calls like implementing permits on big walls in Yosemite and handing out citations for “smelling” that half oz of weed in your back seat. Now they’ve gone ahead and ensured that the access of climbers will no longer be jeopardized by these blatant violations of nesting closures.
