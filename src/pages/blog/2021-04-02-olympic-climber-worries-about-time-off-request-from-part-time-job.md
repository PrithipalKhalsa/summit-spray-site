Part time coach, coffee barista, and olympian Kyra Condie expressed concern to us that her manager may not approve her two week “vacation” to go compete as a US Athlete for the 2021 Summer Olympics. When asked about her part time jobs Kyra commented, “I really want to go compete but I can’t get fired. I don’t make any money from rock climbing and Salt Lake is getting more expensive every year. Plus without a job I can’t afford the $220 membership at The Front.” Training on 6mm, Kyra clings to financial stability through two jobs while writing training programs and her personal climbing schedule.

Kyra commented, “My manager at the Salt Lake coffee corner is usually pretty flexible, but two weeks is tough to get coverage, and somehow I think Utah is lowering the minimum wage.” Kyra seems to use her superhuman ability to not only crush dynos and training, but the pistachios on your latte as well. 



We inquired if her sponsors supported her financially. “My primary sponsor, Penguin Fingers, only pays me in fish. I’m also on the TikTok creator fund so that helps with parking meters. Besides those, professional climbing really doesn’t pay much.”
