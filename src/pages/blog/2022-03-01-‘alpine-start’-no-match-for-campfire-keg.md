description: YOSEMITE VALLEY -- “We had solid plans for a 4 am alpine start.”
  Tim Shannoff’s alpine start was one of the tragic victims claimed by Joe
  Danger’s nightcap campfire keg. “It came out of nowhere, we were totally
  blindsided. One minute, we were slapping our thighs saying ‘well, it’s about
  that time’, the next thing I knew we were doing body shots off Cindy’s six
  pack. At some point in the night, as I was running from a ranger, my 4:15
  alarm went off.”

YOSEMITE VALLEY -- “We had solid plans for a 4 am alpine start.” Tim Shannoff’s alpine start was one of the tragic victims claimed by Joe Danger’s nightcap campfire keg. “It came out of nowhere, we were totally blindsided. One minute, we were slapping our thighs saying ‘well, it’s about that time’, the next thing I knew we were doing body shots off Cindy’s six pack. At some point in the night, as I was running from a ranger, my 4:15 alarm went off.”



Sources confirm that Joe Danger’s keg wreaked havoc on anyone's ability to wake up early or form coherent english. Camp 4 was a horrific site of hungover, decomposing, groaning climbers. Every one of them shell shocked from the night before.



“It’s likely the only shower I’ll get this week. So I had to take advantage of the opportunity.” Cindy told us, regarding the bodyshots. “Plus if they drank more, there would be less left for me. I even thought ‘maybe I can get to bed before my alarm goes off’. I knew I was screwed when Joe brought out the ketamine. In my culture (wook from Oregon), it is extremely rude to turn down K at a campfire. Like, slap your mom bad.”
