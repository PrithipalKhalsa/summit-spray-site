Abby Volm is currently thru-hiking in South America on the Greater Patagonia Trail, we spoke with her yesterday via a satellite phone she ‘found’. “It’s so amazing down here, the people, the environment, and just the trail in general.” Abby told us as her hiker stenched leaked through the phone. “The only bummer is I never got the time off approved at work.”



Abby works as a sales representative at an REI in Northern California. She ‘borrowed’ all of the gear for her trip after REI fired the workers pushing for a union. “I’ve been calling in sick everyday with a different excuse. I’m starting to run out of reasons and I think they are beginning to notice. Various surgeries, car accidents, missing limbs and I keep making up new covid strains. The list goes on. As far as they know I’ve totaled three subarus, had six of my parents die and delivered five babies.”



Originally I asked for a couple weeks off, but my request was denied by my boss. He left a note on the denial saying: “You didn’t sell enough memberships this year to deserve time off. If you sell more I would consider giving you a couple days off next year.”
