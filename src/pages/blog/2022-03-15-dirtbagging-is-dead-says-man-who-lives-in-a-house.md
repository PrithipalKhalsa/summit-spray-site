BOULDER, COLORADO -- Cedar Wright is a former self-made Dirtbag who now resides in a house here in town. The self-proclaimed film maker has been outspoken about the ‘Death of the Dirtbag’. A lifestyle that he calls “totally rad man”.

“It’s kinda the worst thing that’s happening right now.” Cedar Wright told us, once we reminded him to use his indoor voice. “Since I moved into a house, I haven’t seen a single dirtbag. I’ve checked everywhere: #dirtbag, #dirtbagging, #imadirtyboy and #stinklines. Maybe they all got jobs and moved on?”

“Climbers these days don’t live as wild as we did. We lived on the fringe, next to nothing, in Yosemite Valley, an hour from my parents house.” Cedar reminisced as he made us crispy tofu in his airfryer. “People don’t even work seasonal gigs anymore. Back in my day, we worked winter jobs for $10 an hour and lived on that. Did the American Dollar lose 65% of its buying power since 1998 or something?!” 

“I may live in a house, but I still live life by the dirtbag ethos that collecting experiences and getting attention is more important than amassing wealth and material objects.”
