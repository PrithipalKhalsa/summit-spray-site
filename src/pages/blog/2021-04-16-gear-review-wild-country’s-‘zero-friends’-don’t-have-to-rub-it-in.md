Lightweight, flexible, and brutally honest, the Zero Friends from Wild Country are a perfect addition to your rack. I was first sent these cams a month ago, but I’ve been avoiding writing a review because I keep crying about it. I still haven’t reviewed them. I just interviewed the head of the engineering team instead.



“Our number one goal is to keep climbers safe. We engineered a top of the line cam. Including a softer metal alloy to mold to the rock, a narrow cam head to fit into podded cracks, and a way to remind trad climbers this danger can be avoided if they simply had more people to hang out with.” Don McGinnis, Wild Country’s head of engineering and friendship, said about their latest model of climbing shame. “These ‘trad dads’ could be going bowling if they had friends, but instead they need trad climbing pictures to impress Dave from work on monday. Our goal is to give them a reality check, since none of these men will ever go to therapy.”



As for this review, these cams sound good, so 4/10 I guess. If you want them and aren’t thinned skinned come pick them up.
