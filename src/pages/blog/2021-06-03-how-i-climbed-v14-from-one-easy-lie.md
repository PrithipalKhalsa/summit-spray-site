We sat down with self proclaimed ‘liar liar pants on fire’ Scott Buttons on his secret to success. “Well it took a lot of vision to make this grade possible for me.” Scott gloated “I had to think of a lie and then say it out loud. Most people don’t think past the first step. That’s really what sets me apart from other athletes. I have the nerve to follow through.”



We pressed Scott to tell us what he lied about to achieve such a fantastic climbing grade. He did not spill the beans to us. 



“I’m working with a marketing team now to formulate a product. I can teach you this one simple lie to help you climb whatever grade you want, for a price of course. It is a multi-step process, 2 or 3 steps maybe.” 



We inquired about footage of his ascent and Scott informed us he would email us the video. We received an email from Scott, but it was just an attached word document that said “ERROR CORRUPTED VIDEO FOOTAGE” 200 times.



Scott seemed rather interested in freeing an El Cap route. “I would love to free Magic Mushroom or the Dawn Wall with this same technique. Although I heard Tom Evans might be back in the valley next season.”
