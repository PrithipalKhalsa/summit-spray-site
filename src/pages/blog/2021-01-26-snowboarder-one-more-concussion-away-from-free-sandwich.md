“Oh man. Did I eat shit? That must have been pretty bad huh. Can you punch my card?” Nearly fucking dead Tim Robin asked us, after he used his skull to hault his 50 mph top speed. Tim said leaning up against the pine tree that helped him get closer to not paying $5 for a sandwich.

“On one hand it’s encouraging life altering head injuries, on the other, free sandos. Pretty even pros and cons list if you ask me.” He briefly looked around and daisyley asked us again, “Oh man. Did I eat it? That must have been pretty bad huh. Can you punch my card?”

It was clear that Tim was in no condition to be interviewed. We reached out to the Jeffrey Pine that caused Tim to forget math. Jeff was unavailable for comment.

We sat down with local ‘Suzie's Subs and Sandwiches’ owner Gus Ganderson. “Everyone on ski patrol knows about our shop so it’s become free advertising I guess. Plus after eight concussions they rarely remember the free sandwich thing anyway. Except for Doug, but we had to cut him off after his 6th free sandwich. He started talking to himself and throwing jars of mustard at us. I think he works with kids now, nice guy.”
