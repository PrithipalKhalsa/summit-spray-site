With a “covid horizon” in sight, people are getting more indignant about safety regulations. We spoke with Zeke, a dumpster diver, about their thoughts on the recent dumpster diving reservation systems required for the hottest of dumpsters. “I’m fully vaxxed, this is absolute nonsense, if I wanted to protect my health I wouldn’t jump into a bin full of trash.” They said between bites of a newly ‘scored’ doughnut.\

Zeke has been living in a van full time for the past 8 years. “Dumpster diving used to be different, back in the good ole days, pizza places would just serve you out the back door.” Zeke lamented, “Now you need a ‘reservation’ and ‘contact tracing’. The only contact I plan on tracing is what I contract in this bin full of rusty metal”

Dumpster wait times have soared to a staggering 30 mins per person, and people are usually limited by the number of “come ups” they can take. The problem is that the system is built such that come ups are subjective and regulators are stretched thin. A solution must be found. We’re calling on you Biden.
