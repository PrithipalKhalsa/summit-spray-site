"We started noticing that some of these front range sport climbers are taking their punter tantrums a little too far." Boulder County access fund coordinator Amanda Dribble has been working hard to mitigate the massive harm done by these outbursts. "It starts off with a simple swear or two and quickly escalates to a full blown crying fit."

"These are our crags and we need to take care of them. We tried several different measures to mitigate the tantrums. Such as telling their mom, taking away their iPhone, and putting them on a time out. Still, in the end, they find a way to be the center of attention." Amanda Dribble lamented to us. "So now we let them release their anger by doing diaper damage control. It's not a perfect solution, but it’s something."

"I love the diapers." Self proclaimed wobbler wizard and 24 year old crybaby Asher Wrinkle told us about their loud expiates. "They are perfect for when I fall off a high point and get a bit too carried away." They explained their post fall frenzy to us in much greater detail, but we don’t feel comfortable publishing it. Let’s just say those diapers are doing god’s work.
