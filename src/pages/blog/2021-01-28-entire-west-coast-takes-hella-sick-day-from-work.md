As coronavirus cases take a dip in California a new odd spike of people calling in sick to work has occurred. A Pacific storm has brought a massive outbreak of stoke to western states. This new trend is worrisome, as not a single person plagued with the illness has seeked medical attention. Instead, they were all seen packing and heading up to the Tahoe area, in an effort to relieve the swelling stoke.



We spoke with meteorologist and virologist Dan McMurphy on his thoughts on why these pacific storms cause massive outbreaks of stoke. “It’s simply science really, the longer time between natural disasters like this, the more intense the effect will be. This is because without frequent storms ‘stoke’ gets bottled up in the hippocampus where the memory of the last hella sick day was stored. Then when the only storm comes the hippocampus overloads causing a massive outbreak of stoke, thus many people fall terribly ill.”



Janet Tyler is a 28 year old accountant from LA who we spoke with at Squaw Meadows. “Yeah I’m sick as fuck dude. I’m by far the sickest person here.” She proclaimed and we quickly backed up six feet to avoid catching her ‘stoke’. We predict she only has 6 months left.
