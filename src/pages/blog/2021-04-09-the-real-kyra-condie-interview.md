We sat down with the real-life Kyra Condie to help sort our falsities in our article last week. We apologize for our inaccurate information and want to make it right.

**We ‘took care of’ the intern who wrote the falsities of the last article. So just to clarify, you don’t actually work at a coffee shop and will have no issue getting to Tokyo for the summer 2021 Olympics?**

**Kyra**: Nope, no problems there! We have the full support from the USOPC and USAC to help us get to the Olympics as well as personal sponsorship deals. Though I do absolutely love coffee so it’s not an unusual place to find me ;). 

**Where Are the Olympics?**

**Kyra**: Tokyo!

**Are they still doing running at the Olympics?**

**Kyra**: I believe so, but it wont be the same without usain bolt competing this year….. 

**What is a flat white, how do you make it, and how is it different from a latte?** 

**Kyra**: A flat white is an inferior cappuccino.

**Where were you on the night of June 4th 2017? Do you have an alibi?**

**Kyra**: Easy, for the last 6 years I’ve always been in Vail, Colorado on the night of June 4th. But I do think that was the day before my 21st birthday so don’t ask too many questions… 

**Why were your fingerprints found at Eleanor’s house?**

**Kyra**: People steal my fingerprints all the time, i cant be held responsible for keeping track of them.

**Are you a robot? Please tell us what you see:**
