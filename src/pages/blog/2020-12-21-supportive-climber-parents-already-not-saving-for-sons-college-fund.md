We visited climbing couple Linda and Tony at their home in Boulder, CO. The thoughtful couple has already not started setting aside college tuition savings for their newborn baby, Alex. Alex is 7.5 pounds, 22 inches tall, has an ape index of plus 2 inches and a grip strength of 3.21 kg.

“Alex is only two months old but we saw him look in the general direction of our Sharma Shrine. We aren’t sure if he will be a great climber, but we are doing everything we can to push him into the sport.” Linda said while rocking her child in his tiny harness “We use chalk instead of baby powder, we use formula made from only Clif Bars, and we aren't saving for any university. After all the rock will be Alex’s teacher, that’s who will give him a higher education.”

“Sure I have a masters in Engineering and my wife is a doctor, but we barely climb 5.12. Our education, social status, and financial stability just isn’t worth such a low climbing grade.” Tony said while lighting incense for the Sharma Shrine. “We really want our child to be able to climb at least climb 5.14, but in the end we just want Alex to follow our dreams.”
