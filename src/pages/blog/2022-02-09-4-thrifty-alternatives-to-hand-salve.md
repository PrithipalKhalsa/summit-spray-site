Need to find another use for your forgotten condiment? When mayo expires it releases four essentially branch chain amino acids: lucine, eucalyptus, manzanita, and sycamore. Simply apply liberally over your desired areas right before bed. In the morning, wash off the salve and re-apply throughout the day.



**Mouth**

Put that ol’ chomper to better use than spraying, get to licking! That's right, did you know your mouth is wet? 



Lickity, slurp, dribble and taste,

A pleasure to moisten with your face.

A damp secret remedy,

For your little extremities.

What?! You mean that van has other uses than giving me lice?! That's right, it also secretes a special healing oil that you can rub all over your body! Baby safe too.



**Put them in freezer**

Cold temperatures are essential to the healing process. It’s true, I asked the school nurse! Remove your fingers and put them in the freezer before you go to bed and you will be amazed at the results.
