“I honestly thought I was going to make way more money.” Said 42 year old filmmaker who definitely isn’t Cedar Wright. The Colorado transplant has spent the last decade seeking out every inch of the climbing lifestyle to put into a movie. His film success has given him a whopping networth of $82, a rack of sketchy cams, a sandwich punch card, and a free massage coupon from a moad wook that he will not be redeeming. “Turns out selling a frugal lifestyle doesn’t really pay the big bucks. Who knew?”

“I used to love selling out the scene in Boulder, but now it sucks due to the influx of migrants from other states. I guess they saw my movies or something.” Not-Wright shouted, in his outdoor voice for some reason. “It’s fine though, I’ll probably just move back to California like everyone else is doing.”

“I honestly feel bad for the new filmmakers on the scene. I really beat the ‘dirtbag lifestyle’ thing into the ground. Like what are they going to do? Make a climbing film about sneaking around in Yosemite? Good luck competing with my other 42 films, bud.” The ex-dirtbag, turned wannabe upscale yuppie, told us.
